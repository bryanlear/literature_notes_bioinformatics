abstract = {The vast majority of missense variants observed in the human genome are of unknown clinical significance. We present AlphaMissense, an adaptation of AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate variant population frequency databases to predict missense variant pathogenicity. By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible human single amino acid substitutions and classify 89\% of missense variants as either likely benign or likely pathogenic. Single–amino acid changes in proteins sometimes have little effect but can often lead to problems in protein folding, activity, or stability. Only a small fraction of variants have been experimentally investigated, but there are vast amounts of biological sequence data that are suitable for use as training data for machine learning approaches. Cheng et al. developed AlphaMissense, a deep learning model that builds on the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2 (see the Perspective by Marsh and Teichmann). The model is trained on population frequency data and uses sequence and predicted structural context, all of which contribute to its performance. The authors evaluated the model against related methods using clinical databases not included in the training and demonstrated agreement with multiplexed assays of variant effect. Predictions for all single–amino acid substitutions in the human proteome are provided as a community resource. —Michael A.

    abstract = {Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract = {A growing amount of noncoding genetic variants, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are found to be associated with complex human traits and diseases. Their mechanistic interpretation is relatively limited and can use the help from computational prediction of their effects on epigenetic profiles. However, current models often focus on local, 1D genome sequence determinants and disregard global, 3D chromatin structure that critically affects epigenetic events.We find that noncoding variants of unexpected high similarity in epigenetic profiles, with regards to their relatively low similarity in local sequences, can be largely attributed to their proximity in chromatin structure. Accordingly, we have developed a multimodal deep learning scheme that incorporates both data of 1D genome sequence and 3D chromatin structure for predicting noncoding variant effects. Specifically, we have integrated convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sequence embedding and graph neural networks for structure embedding despite the resolution gap between the two types of data, while utilizing recent DNA language models. Numerical results show that our models outperform competing sequence-only models in predicting epigenetic profiles and their use of long-range interactions complement sequence-only models in extracting regulatory motifs. They prove to be excellent predictors for noncoding variant effects in gene expression and pathogenicity, whether in unsupervised “zero-shot” learning or supervised “few-shot” learning.Codes and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/ncVarPred-1D3D and https://zenodo.org/record/7975777.},

ABSTRACT = {Cholangiocarcinoma is a deadly cancer worldwide, associated with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Although cholangiocarcinoma accounts for less than 15% of liver primary cancer, its silent nature restricts early diagnosis and prevents efficient treatment. Therefore, it is of clinical relevance to better understand the molecular basis of cholangiocarcinoma, including the signaling pathways that contribute to tumor onset and progression. In this review, we discuss the genetic, molecular, and environmental factors that promote cholangiocarcinoma, emphasizing the role of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway in the progression of this cancer. We provide an overview of the physiological functions of TGFβ signaling in preserving liver homeostasis and describe how advanced cholangiocarcinoma benefits from the tumor-promoting effects of TGFβ. Moreover, we report the importance of noncoding RNAs as effector molecules downstream of TGFβ during cholangiocarcinoma progression, and conclude by highlighting the need for identifying novel and clinically relevant biomarkers for a better management of patients with cholangiocarcinoma.},

abstract = {When omics measurements are employed to discover novel parts of a pathway of interest, experiments are usually designed to induce variation in said pathway. Experimental treatment groups can display differences including beyond the pathway of interest. Pathway discovery by coexpression analysis is therefore hampered by the dominant variance induced by the design. However, minor changes in ambient conditions that could not be controlled for, affect the biological sample. This can lead to small, coordinated differences in gene expression or metabolite concentration. These differences can occur within pathways of interest between replicates in the same controlled experimental condition. These systematic differences are usually not directly considered, but we argue here that they can be used to improve the detection of features that co-express. We introduce a novel framework “MASCARA” which combines ANOVA simultaneous component analysis and partial least squares regression to remove the experimentally induced va          ariance and investigate multivariate relationships in the non-designed variance. Through extensive simulations that mimic the structure of a designed transcriptome study, the benefits of MASCARA are demonstrated and tested against a selection of commonly used methods. In a coexpression analysis of a real dataset MASCARA detects several relevant novel transcripts. The concept is further demonstrated in a designed metabolomics study. Here, distinct groups of features more tightly related within treatment groups or related across experimental conditions can be described. Our results indicate that after adjusting for experimental differences, the remaining variance contains enough useful structure to study coexpression.}
